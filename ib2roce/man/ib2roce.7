.SH NAME
ib2roce \- Bridge RDMA traffic between infiniband and ROCE
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
ib2roce is used to bridge RDMA traffic between Infiniband nodes and Ethernet nodes using ROCE to
enable RDMA native communication between devices on Infiniband with devices on ROCE.

At this point only multicast bridging is supported. The bridge will simply
replicate multicast traffic between the two fabrics by joining the multicast
group on either interface and forwarding it to the other.

IB2ROCE prevents multicast loop back through a couple of measures including
a filter on incoming traffic. Multicast loop back is switched off. If that
measure is not sufficient, because that feature is not supported or
local clients need loop back, then
the filter will do its task.
.SH "NOTES"
The Infiniband to ROCE bridge does not support true RDMA memory transfers
but only messaging in UDP / UD frames. Those are supported in both
unicast and multicast modes. However, unicast mode is not mature and usually
disabled by default.
