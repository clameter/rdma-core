.SH NAME
ib2roce \- Bridge RDMA traffic between infiniband and ROCE
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B ib2roce
is used to bridge RDMA traffic between Infiniband nodes and Ethernet nodes using ROCE to
enable RDMA native multicast communication between devices on Infiniband with devices on ROCE.

Only multicast bridging is supported. The bridge will replicate multicast traffic between the two fabrics by joining the multicast
group on either interface and forwarding it to the other. PGM is used by default to create reliable multicast traffic and ib2roce can understand that
protocol and diagnose PGM streams according to RFC3208.

The bridge consists of the
.BR ib2roce(1)
daemon which does the fowarding and a command line tool that allows control of the bridge called
.BR bcom(1)

There are also two tools to allow the creating of multicast traffic
.BR mcsender(1)
and the reception of multicast traffic
.BR mclistener(1).
These are useful for diagnostic purposes.

.SH "NOTES"
The Infiniband to ROCE bridge does not support true RDMA memory transfers
but only messaging in UDP / UD frames. Unicast is only supported in the context of the PGM protocol for NAK forwarding.
